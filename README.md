# CameraCalculations
A library built to facilitate robot localization and target location discovery based on the output of connected cameras, usually through OpenCV or GRIP (https://github.com/WPIRoboticsProjects/GRIP/releases/tag/v1.5.2).

# Explanation of Function
The purpose of this library is to abstract away the calculations used to extract useful information from camera feeds. However, in addition to heavy in-code commentary, one can find an in-depth explanation of the associated math here:
